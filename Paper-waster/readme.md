Problem:  
  There a lot of organizations still use a traditional way to collect information - paper form.  
  Except for wasting paper, they need to waste a lot of time to key in information to the computer by human hands.  
  In some situations that paper form is a necessary way, I want to automate the process which is from paper form to computer .  
    
Input:  
  * Standardized form(picture file)  
  * Handwriting information at the specific location  
   
Output:  
  * xlsx file
