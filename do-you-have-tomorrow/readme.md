This idea will realize by app or website.  
The main goal are find the people who can't survive tomorrow(less than 60 days) and the people who have just enough ability and willing to help others. 
Match them.  
  
If SOMEONE doesn't have enough food, and SOMEONE has foods that is about to expire but too much to finish.  
Great! you are great partner!  
If SOMEONE has a terrible day, and SOMEONE willing to bring happiness to others.  
Bingo!  
  
I want to make this kind of match instant, convenient and easy to operate.  
Minimize the cost of helping others and seeking help.  
  
  
Implementation:
